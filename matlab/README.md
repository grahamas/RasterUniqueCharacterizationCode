Use the `FIGURE_X_SCRIPT.m` files to generate Figure X for X = 2-6. (Note that Figure 1 was reprinted from prior works.)

Before generating Figures 5 and 6, add `DATA_and_SCRIPTS_for_Figs5_and_6` and `COMPLETE_ANALYSIS_for_Figs5_and_6` to your working path in Matlab.

To re-run the triple correlation analysis, generate the completed triple correlation analyses by running `rat_cultures_script_analysis.m` in `DATA_and_SCRIPTS_for_Figs5_and_6`.
